romantic_project

I was inspired by a freelance request I came across, and after reflecting on it, I decided to create something similar. Nothing extraordinary, but as I worked through it, it somehow evolved into something more â€” a project with heart and soul. It's simple yet meaningful, and I believe it carries a little piece of passion in every line.
